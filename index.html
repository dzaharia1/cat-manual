                <p><strong>‚ò¢Ô∏è Seriously: Champagne has cancer, and takes chemo to manage it. What this means for you is that anything that comes out of his body, you must handle with gloves. No exceptions. The gloves are in the guest bathroom, in the drawer under the sink.</strong></p>

            <p>Greetings, valued MartianCorp‚Ñ¢ Technician! Thank you for accepting this vital assignment ‚Äì the stabilization and optimization of our cherished feline, Champagne (AKA Domestic Feline Control Unit, AKA DFCU)! As you‚Äôre undoubtedly aware, Champagne is a singularly remarkable floofernutter, possessing a few‚Ä¶ specialized requirements and a naturally reticent nature. <br>However, he‚Äôs a remarkably intelligent little friend, and will no doubt appreciate your diligent efforts to maintain his peak operational status while Dan and Martha are engaged in critical data collection assignments.</p>
            <p>Your precise and systematic approach will ensure Champagne's continued functionality and contribute significantly to the overall harmony of our Domestic Feline Control Unit (DFCU) matrix. Let‚Äôs get to work, and ensure a flawlessly synchronized future‚Äì together!‚Ñ¢¬©</p>
            <p><strong>And don't forget. Champagne is "Always a Good Boy!"‚Ñ¢</strong></p>
            <h3><strong>Emergencies</strong></h3>
            <p><strong>Champagne is a healthy cat, with little unique needs apart from his meds. But if anything does happen, and you need to take him to the vet, the nearest emergency vet is here. His carrier is in the guest room closet, on the right.</strong></p>
            <strong>

            <h2>Supply Depots</h2>
            <img src="./public/supplies.png" alt="Champagne supplies">
            <p>All supplies you could ever need (and more!) are available in the two supply depot locations, conveniently located near the entrance, on the right side of the credenza, and underneath the guest bathroom sink, respectively. For your convenience, here‚Äôs a [non-exhaustive] list of available items at the supply depot:</p>

            <strong><h3>Entrance Supply Depot</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Food (F.O.O.D.)
                    <ul>
                        <li>Dry - in canister, with scoop</li>
                        <li>Wet (W.F.O.O.D.) - in serving containers</li>
                        <li>Treats (D.F.O.O.D.) - In branded baggies</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Medicine
                    <ul>
                        <li>Mirataz, for appetite. <strong>PUT ON GLOVES and apply a line of mirataz about half an inch long. Then rub it into his ear.</strong> Do not get any on your skin, because it works on humans and will actually trigger your appetite.</li>
                        <li>Chemotherapy. We will rarely ever ask you to give him his chemo, because it‚Äôs much more difficult. Don‚Äôt worry about this part, but just in case, be aware that it‚Äôs kept in the fridge door.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Bathroom Supply Depot</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Gloves</li>
                <li>Poop bags for cleaning the litter box</li>
            </ul></strong>
        </div>

        <div id="food" class="tab-content hidden">
            <h2>F.O.O.D.‚Ñ¢ Fuel</h2>
            <img src="./public/food.png" alt="Champagne eating F.O.O.D.">
            <h3>Dry</h3>
            <p>There‚Äôs nothing that Champagne and his trusty DFCU matrix appreciate more than a heaping bowl of dry F.O.O.D. That‚Äôs right‚Äì <strong>F</strong>issile <strong>O</strong>smium-188 <strong>O</strong>rally-administered <strong>D</strong>igestibles. YUM!</p>
            <p>But watch out! Too much, and Champagne‚Äôs DFCU will trigger an up-flow and you‚Äôll be <strong>cleaning</strong> that F.O.O.D. out from his favorite hiding spot. Yuck! That‚Äôs why MartianCorp technicians developed a DFCU-specialized F.O.O.D. delivery system that ensures controlled intake of fuel. We just call it his B.O.W.L. Heh! <strong>Fresh F.O.O.D. can be acquired at Champagne‚Äôs supply depository. Just make sure to fill the B.O.W.L. so that the protruding spikes remain visible to prevent over-intake</strong>. That way there isn‚Äôt enough F.O.O.D. for him to gorge himself on. That‚Äôs enough beta-emissions for you, ya lil' atomic rascal! Am I right??</p>

            <h3>Wet</h3>
            <p>What makes F.O.O.D. go down even easier than a scrumptious side of W.F.O.O.D.? What‚Äôs W.F.O.O.D.? Why it‚Äôs the same fuel your DFCU trusts, but with a little ‚ÄúWet‚Äù Deuterium to ‚Äúlighten‚Äù things up! Save some for the rest of us, Champagne!</p>
            <p><strong>W.F.O.O.D. is administered once per sun-cycle.</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Start by removing the W.F.O.O.D. dish from Champagne‚Äôs W.F.O.O.D. automator by pushing the white button on the front.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Clean off any W.F.O.O.D. from the previous sun-cycle with a damp paper towel</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Plop in the contents of one W.F.O.O.D. serving pack</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Fill the now-empty serving pack with water and pour that in with the W.F.O.O.D.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Mush that together into a paste.</strong> Yum.</li>
            </ol>
            </strong>


            <h3>D.F.O.O.D. (Discretionary F.O.O.D., or Treats‚Ñ¢!)</h3>
            <p>Champagne is ‚ÄúAlways a Good Boy!‚Äù‚Ñ¢ so we like to reward him with the D.F.O.O.D. he likes best! Compared to the other MartianCorp DFCUs, Champagne‚Äôs Situational Awareness and Response protocol subsystems are a bit more finely honed, making him, let‚Äôs just say, a more ‚Äúhesitant‚Äù customer.</p>
            <p>If he doesn‚Äôt come right away when you offer him a D.F.O.O.D. (or three ü§£) just leave it on the floor, where he can detect it with his optical sensor array, and he‚Äôll scoop it up right when you look away. Woah, where‚Äôd it go??</p>

            <h3>Water</h3>
            <p>No mystery here! DFCUs get hot hot hot, and need a constant supply of coolant to run smooth as butter. That‚Äôs why Champagne has three water bowls. One under the stool in the master bedroom, one in the living room beside the master bedroom door, and one under the round table in the guest room.</p>
            <p><strong>Just check on his water bowls to make sure that there is clean, clear water in them. If there isn't? Make it so!</strong></p>
        </div>

        <div id="medicine" class="tab-content hidden">
            <h2>Medicine</h2>
            <img src="./public/meds.png" alt="Champagne with Meds">
            <p>As we love to say, Champagne is a unique DFCU. He just needs some extra maintenance for smooth operation. But we stand by our pledge. Say it with us! He‚Äôs ‚ÄúAlways a Good Boy!‚Äù‚Ñ¢</p>

            <h2>Appetite meds - Mirataz</h2>
            <div class="warning">
                <p>Don't get Mirataz on your skin. Just treat it like you would any medication you were giving to another person.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Because of the Chemo Champagne takes, he can have trouble keeping up his enthusiasm for F.O.O.D., W.F.O.O.D. and D.F.O.O.D. So we do it for him with Mirataz‚Ñ¢brand ear ointment (available in the Supply Depot)</p>
            <p><strong>Mirataz is administered every 48 hours (loosely) and can be found in the entrance supply depot.</strong></p>

            <h4><strong>Administration</strong></h4>
            <ol> 
                <li><strong>Put gloves on both hands. Gloves can be acquired in the Bathroom Supply Depot.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Apply a line of Mirataz about half an inch long to your gloved finger.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Gently rub the Mirataz into Champagne's inner ear flap. Avoid getting it on his fur.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Discard gloves immediately after administration in a designated biohazard waste bag (poop bags from the Bathroom Supply Depot are suitable).</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Wash hands thoroughly with soap and water.</strong></li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Chemotherapy</h2>
            <p>You will almost definitely not be asked to give Champagne his Chemo. But just in case, it's in the refrigerator, and is
            a single pill.</p>
            
            <div class="warning">
                <p>Don't start handling the Chemo (even the bag itself) without gloves on.</p>
            </div>
            <h4>Administration</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Put gloves on both hands. Gloves can be acquired in the Bathroom Supply Depot.</li>
                <li>The pills are in individual pill envelopes in the bag. Remove a pill from the bag.</li>
                <li>Hold champagne to your belly, with his back to you. Use your legs to gently restrain him.</li>
                <li>Pull his head back gently. When his head is far back enough, he will open his mouth. Quickly place the pull as far back into his mouth as you are able.</li>
                <li>Don't let him go right away. You may need to hold his mouth shut for a moment, and you'll notice him swallowing.</li>
                <li>Let him go. He will absolutely hide.</li>
            </ol>
